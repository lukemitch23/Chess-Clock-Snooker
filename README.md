## Outline
**Ever thought a game of snooker needed to be against the clock? If so this app is for you!** 

The app is built in Swift that combines a classic chess countdown clock for two people with the game of snooker. The app comprises of two countdown clocks just like a chess clock but with the addition of 7 coloured balls. Each time you pot a ball, press the button of that colour and get extra seconds on your time. The player who survives the longest without running out of time wins!
